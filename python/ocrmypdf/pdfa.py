Generate a PDFMARK file for Ghostscript >= 9.14, for PDF/A conversion

pdfmark is an extension to the Postscript language that describes some PDF
features like bookmarks and annotations. It was originally specified Adobe
Distiller, for Postscript to PDF conversion:
https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdfmark_reference.pdf

Ghostscript uses pdfmark for PDF to PDF/A conversion as well. To use Ghostscript
to create a PDF/A, we need to create a pdfmark file with the necessary metadata.

This takes care of the many version-specific bugs and pecularities in
Ghostscript's handling of pdfmark.
