lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
API.

It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.

To contact the project, go to the `project home page
<http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at
https://launchpad.net/lxml

In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
you can get it from the github repository at
https://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to
build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home
page.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will
install lxml from
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have
an appropriate version of Cython installed.


After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become
available at
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-4.4 .
Running ``easy_install lxml==4.4bugfix`` will install
the unreleased branch state from
https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-4.4#egg=lxml-4.4bugfix
as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this
requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.

4.4.0 (2019-07-27)
==================

Features added
--------------

* ``Element.clear()`` accepts a new keyword argument ``keep_tail=True`` to
  clear everything but the tail text.  This is helpful in some document-style
  use cases.

* When creating attributes or namespaces from a dict in Python 3.6+, lxml now
  preserves the original insertion order of that dict, instead of always sorting
  the items by name.  A similar change was made for ElementTree in CPython 3.8.
  See https://bugs.python.org/issue34160

* Integer elements in ``lxml.objectify`` implement the ``__index__()`` special method.

* GH#269: Read-only elements in XSLT were missing the ``nsmap`` property.
  Original patch by Jan Pazdziora.

* ElementInclude can now restrict the maximum inclusion depth via a ``max_depth``
  argument to prevent content explosion.  It is limited to 6 by default.

* The ``target`` object of the XMLParser can have ``start_ns()`` and ``end_ns()``
  callback methods to listen to namespace declarations.

* The ``TreeBuilder`` has new arguments ``comment_factory`` and ``pi_factory`` to
  pass factories for creating comments and processing instructions, as well as
  flag arguments ``insert_comments`` and ``insert_pis`` to discard them from the
  tree when set to false.

* A `C14N 2.0 <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-c14n2/>`_ implementation was added as
  ``etree.canonicalize()``, a corresponding ``C14NWriterTarget`` class, and
  a ``c14n2`` serialisation method.

Bugs fixed
----------

* When writing to file paths that contain the URL escape character '%', the file
  path could wrongly be mangled by URL unescaping and thus write to a different
  file or directory.  Code that writes to file paths that are provided by untrusted
  sources, but that must work with previous versions of lxml, should best either
  reject paths that contain '%' characters, or otherwise make sure that the path
  does not contain maliciously injected '%XX' URL hex escapes for paths like '../'.

* Assigning to Element child slices with negative step could insert the slice at
  the wrong position, starting too far on the left.

* Assigning to Element child slices with overly large step size could take very
  long, regardless of the length of the actual slice.

* Assigning to Element child slices of the wrong size could sometimes fail to
  raise a ValueError (like a list assignment would) and instead assign outside
  of the original slice bounds or leave parts of it unreplaced.

* The ``comment`` and ``pi`` events in ``iterwalk()`` were never triggered, and
  instead, comments and processing instructions in the tree were reported as
  ``start`` elements.  Also, when walking an ElementTree (as opposed to its root
  element), comments and PIs outside of the root element are now reported.

* LP#1827833: The RelaxNG compact syntax support was broken with recent versions
  of ``rnc2rng``.

* LP#1758553: The HTML elements ``source`` and ``track`` were added to the list
  of empty tags in ``lxml.html.defs``.

* Registering a prefix other than "xml" for the XML namespace is now rejected.

* Failing to write XSLT output to a file could raise a misleading exception.
  It now raises ``IOError``.

Other changes
-------------

* Support for Python 3.4 was removed.

* When using ``Element.find*()`` with prefix-namespace mappings, the empty string
  is now accepted to define a default namespace, in addition to the previously
  supported ``None`` prefix.  Empty strings are more convenient since they keep
  all prefix keys in a namespace dict strings, which simplifies sorting etc.

* The ``ElementTree.write_c14n()`` method has been deprecated in favour of the
  long preferred ``ElementTree.write(f, method="c14n")``.  It will be removed
  in a future release.
